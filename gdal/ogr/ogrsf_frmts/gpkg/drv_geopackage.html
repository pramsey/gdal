<h1>GeoPackage</h1>

<p>This driver implements support for access to spatial tables in the 
<a href="http://opengis.github.io/geopackage/">OGC GeoPackage format standard</a>.
The GeoPackage standard uses a SQLite database file as a generic container, and the standard defines:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Expected metadata tables (<code>gpkg_contents</code>, <code>gpkg_spatial_ref_sys</code>, <code>gpkg_geometry_columns</code>)</li>
  <li>Binary format encoding for geometries in spatial tables (basically a GPKG standard header object followed by ISO standard well-known binary (WKB))</li>
  <li>Naming and conventions for extensions (extended feature types) and indexes (how to use SQLite r-tree in an interoperable manner)</li>
</ul>
<p>This driver reads and writes SQLite files from the file system, so it must be run by a user with read/write access to the files it is working with.</p>

<h2>Opening a file</h2>

<p>...</p>

<h2>SQL</h2>

<p>The driver supports OGR attribute filters, and users are expected
  to provide filters in the SQLite dialect, as they will be executed directly
  against the database.
</p>

<h2>Creation Issues</h2>

<p>When creating a new GeoPackage file, the driver will attempt to
  force the database into a UTF-8 mode for text handling, satisfying 
  the OGR strict UTF-8 capability. For pre-existing files, the driver
  will work with whatever it's given.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Simple translation of a single shapefile into GeoPackage.  The table 'abc' will
be created with the features from abc.shp and attributes from abc.dbf. 
The file <code>filename.gpkg</code> must <strong>not</strong> already exist, as it will be created.
<pre>
% ogr2ogr -f GPKG filename.gpkg abc.shp
</pre>
</li>

<li>
Translation of a directory of shapefiles into a GeoSpackage. Each file will end
up as a new table within the GPKG file.
The file <code>filename.gpkg</code> must <strong>not</strong> already exist, as it will be created.
<pre>
% ogr2ogr -f GPKG filename.gpkg ./path/to/dir
</pre>
</li>

<li>
Translation of a PostGIS database into a GeoPackage. Each table in the database will end up
as a table in the GPKG file.
The file <code>filename.gpkg</code> must <strong>not</strong> already exist, as it will be created.
<pre>
% ogr2ogr -f GPKG filename.gpkg PG:'dbname=mydatabase host=localhost'
</pre>
</li>
